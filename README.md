# Basketball Team Stats Tool
This is a Python program for a basketball game statistics tool. The program begins by cleaning a list of player dictionaries that contain information such as player names, guardians, experience, and height. The cleaned list is then used to create balanced teams of six players each. The program has a function that extracts player names from the teams, and another function that displays statistics for a selected team.


To use the program, run the basketball_tool() function. This will display a menu with two options: A) Display Team Stats and B) Quit. Selecting option A will prompt the user to pick a team from the list of available teams. After selecting a team, the program will display the statistics for the selected team, including the total number of players, a list of player names, and some additional information. Selecting option B will exit the program.
